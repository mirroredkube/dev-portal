## Scaffolder

The Scaffolder enables you to provide software templates to your teams. Software templates are composed of a YAML definition and, typically, a skeleton directory. You can define the parameters that will be asked from the user and the steps that the template will execute. The community templates can help you get ideas of the templates' potential. 

The Scaffolder lets you register templates that your users can use through Backstageâ€™s UI.
